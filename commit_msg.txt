feat(account-settings): add account settings and enforce privacy logic

- Separate profile updates from account settings management into dedicated services/DTOs.
- Implement "Lazy Creation" for AccountSettings: records are only created in the DB when the user updates them for the first time.
- Optimize profile retrieval using EF Core projection to fetch basic info and privacy settings in a single query with virtual defaults.
- Enforce backend privacy checks:
    - Set Email, Phone, and Address to null in Profile response if viewer lacks permissions.
    - Throw ForbiddenException when accessing Followers/Following lists if privacy settings restrict access.
- Include DefaultPostPrivacy in Login/Token Refresh responses for frontend synchronization.
- Update Response DTOs to support nullable fields (Email, Settings) for unauthorized access scenarios.
